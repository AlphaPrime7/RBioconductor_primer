# BiocManager- The R package used for interfacing Bioconductor. 

A topic that seemed too difficult for me to comprehend when I was on the outskirts of bioinformatics
now seems relatively easy. This package is used to access some useful bioinformatics 
tools and I am particularly interested in the cytometry tools given my interest in a 
cytometry role at the Stowers Institute. Moreover, who am I if I dont know what BiocManager is.
Although I am slowly extending my interest past bioinformatics, these are simple things
I should have known.
